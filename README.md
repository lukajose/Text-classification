***Our final, chosen model can be found in 'ensemble_final.py', using the final parameters found in 'final_parameters.json'***
Also in this repo is the code for additional models explored (Boosting,SGD,Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression,Naive Bayes)
As well as further HPO, feature selection work.
Each team member followed the structure of 'template.py' when tuning the additional models explored.
